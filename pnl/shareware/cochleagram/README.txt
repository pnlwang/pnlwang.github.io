******************************************************************************

The toolbox contains the following Matlab functions:

gammatone.m - Produce an array of filtered responses from a Gammatone 
	filterbank.

meddis.m - Produce auditory nerve response from output of a Gammatone 
	filterbank.

cochleagram.m - Produce a cochleagram from output of a Gammatone filterbank.

ibm.m - Produce an IBM processed mixture.

synthesis.m - Resynthesize a waveform signal from a mixture signal and 
	a binary mask.

cochplot.m - Display the image of a cochleagram with proper coordinate labels

erb2hz.m - Convert ERB-rate scale to normal frequency scale.

hz2erb.m - Convert normal frequency scale in hz to ERB-rate scale.

loudness.m - Compute loudness level in Phons on the basis of equal-loudness
	functions.


In addition,

f_af_bf_cf.mat - Contains parameter values of equal-loudness functions from BS3383,
"Normal equal-loudness level contours for pure tones under free-field listening conditions", table 1. 


Examples on how to use the toolbox:

* To genenarate and display a cochleagram without hair cell transduction, type the following:
      	gf = gammatone(Signal);        
	cg = cochleagram(gf);
	cochplot(cg);

* To genenarate and display a cochleagram with hair cell transduction, type the following:
      	gf = gammatone(inputSignal);        
	hc = meddis(gf);
	cg = cochleagram(hc);
	cochplot(cg);


Other comments:

- When using Matlab function 'wavread', the amplitudes are limited to the range [-1,+1], which are
much smaller than original integers coded in a wavefile. It is important, particularly for hair cell 
transduction, that the amplitudes are scaled up to the original range. With 16-bit precision, the scaling 
can be simply done by multiplying with power(2, 15), or Matlab function 'pow2(15)'.

- The Matlab version is several times slower than C/C++ version, which is downloadable
from http://www.cse.ohio-state.edu/pnl/software.html (follow "Voiced speech segregation").

- More detailed comments for each function are given in the M-file.
