This C program is used for producing the results presented in the following 
article:

Linsay P.S. and Wang D.L. (1998): "Fast numerical integration of relaxation   
oscillator networks based on singular limit solutions," IEEE Transactions 
on Neural Networks, vol. 9, 523-532. 


We distribute these programs freely, but please cite the paper
if you have made any use of these programs.


"singular.c": this program integrates a system of relaxation oscillators
	in the singular limit. The algorithm is described in detail
	in the above paper.

"singular.h": the header file for "singular.c".

Stim: The 50x50 stimulus pattern used to test the system.
