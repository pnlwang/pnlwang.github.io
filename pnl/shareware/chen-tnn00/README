This set of C programs is used for producing the results presented in the 
following article:

Chen K., Wang D.L., and Liu X.: "Weight adaptation and oscillatory 
correlation for image segmentation," IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks, 
vol. 11, pp. 1106-1123, 2000. 

We distribute these programs freely, but please cite the paper
if you have made any use of these programs.


fps.c: this program smoothes an image using the feature-preserving smoothing
	algorithm described in the paper. For simplicity, we give the
	version that operates directly on pixels rather than the one
	that operates on connection weights. As noted in the paper,
	the two versions are equivalent in terms of smoothing performance.
	
	The program takes as input a pgm image, and outputs the result
	also as a pgm file. There are a few adjustable parameters. In
	general, however, minimal parameter tuning is required to 
	produce reasonable results for the same type of imagery.

cwl.c: this program segments an image using an improved LEGION algorithm
	(compared to the original one given by Wang and Terman in their
	1997 Neural Computation article), as described in the paper.

	The program takes as input a pgm image, and outputs the result
	also as a pgm file, where different segments are coded by
	different gray levels. There are a few adjustable parameters. 
	The key one is the level of global inhibition, Wz.
