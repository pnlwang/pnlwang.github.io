This C program is used for producing the results presented in the following 
article:

Wang D.L. and Terman D. (1997): "Image segmentation based on oscillatory 
correlation,". Neural Computation, vol. 9, 805-836 (For errata see 
Neural Computation, vol. 9, 1623-1626, 1997). Also, for an earlier but 
extended version with detailed analysis see "Image segmentation based on 
oscillatory correlation," Technical Report 19, Center for Cognitive Science, 
The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, USA. 

We distribute these programs freely, but please cite the paper
if you have made any use of these programs.


"segment.c": this program performs image segmentation based on an algorithm
	extracted from LEGION dynamics. The algorithm is described in detail
	in the above paper.

"segment.h": the header file for "segment.c".

images: The three gray-level images used in the paper are given under
	directory /images.
