"terman.c": this program implements a 20x20 LEGION network that 
	segments an input image "OHIO". The equations are solved using
	the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method. The output is contained in 
	a data file. The mechanism and related 
	equations are described in detail in the above paper.

"terman.h": the header file for "terman.c".
