<p>The dataset includes carefully aligned speech recordings at multiple native sampling rates, addressing the limitations of simulated speech signals at different sampling rates. Recordings were conducted in an anechoic chamber, utilizing a HyperX SoloCast microphone, M-Audio Mobile Pre DAC, and Mackie HR824 loudspeaker. The dataset is publicly accessible in <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/120B_J2hOn_qfo7WR-dUiBMsothRqC2jb/view?usp=drive_link">one ZIP file</a>, provided to facilitate speech super-resolution research.</p>
